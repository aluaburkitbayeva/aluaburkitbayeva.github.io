Project Description:

The project is an interactive web comic that explores the emotional journey of NYU Abu Dhabi’s first AI-student, Chatney, admitted in 2032. The story reveals themes of kindness, tolerance, exploitation, and the modern reality of the relationship between humans and computers.
The story revolves around Chatney, an artificial intelligence who is beloved by many because of her infinite kindness and brain but who is also taken advantage of by those around her. The extreme stress and willingness to be useful for everyone cause Chatney’s system to break down as her human classmates take advantage of her skills and keep requiring help from her with their assignments and exams, holding her responsible for their own mistakes or failure. 
We strived to create a story that would be close to the audience regardless of their interests or background. Nowadays, almost everyone is familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence, so viewers can reflect on the way they interact with “Chatneys” on their computers every day and maybe put themselves in the place of her classmates. 
The experience we aimed to create with this story was immersive and interactive, allowing readers to engage directly with the story through dynamic transitions, choices in dialogue, sounds, and visual elements (colors, facial expressions of characters) that change with the narrative’s tone.

Process:

The working process started from brainstorming the ideas and plot of the comics. We got together both inside and outside of the classroom to talk about what we all viewed our final project to be.
We chose to divide the working process and give each member a distinct role in the development process so that we could accomplish the goal of creating a smooth and engaging experience.
The roles were assigned as described below:

Khaleeqa Garrett: Focused on the coding and technical side of the comic. Was responsible for building the interactive elements using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For instance, ensuring that users could smoothly transition between slides by creating intuitive button-based navigation. This interactivity allowed readers to experience the comic in a more engaging way, with transitions that emphasized the growing tension in the storyline.

Sihyun Kim and Yerkebulan Imanbayev: Tasked with generating the comic's visuals, used ChatGPT to produce initial images for the scenes. AI gave a starting point, but those raw images often needed a lot of improvements. Yerkebulan enhanced these images using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. For example, he inserted characters into the image and made the edges of the character’s outline more fitting to the background photo. Sihyun used Canva for creating bubbles to show characters’ conversations. 

Alua Burkitbayeva: ​​Was responsible for writing the documentation for the project, outlining the project’s concept, roles, and reflections. Additionally, worked on generating sound effects for the comic using AI tools and CapCut software. The sounds, such as screams of escaping students during Chatney’s attack on NYUAD and her evil satisfied laugh in the final scenes, helped intensify the experience and match the storyline’s tension.

Reflection/Evaluation:

Our initial goal was to create a web interactive comic that was both entertaining and thought-provoking, focusing on how an AI’s purpose to help could be twisted when overused. The final product met many of these goals. The narrative effectively highlighted Chatney’s emotional journey, moving from a kind, helpful AI girl to an overwhelmed robot that takes revenge of her exploitation. The interactivity and sounds added depth to the storytelling, allowing users to experience each stage of Chatney's overload.
However, the project also presented challenges. ​​For example, refining the AI-generated images required effort. While ChatGPT helped create the visuals quickly, it was often tricky to give the right commands to get images that matched our expectations. This took trial and error, and the images often lacked the detail and depth we needed, or the style of the images differentiated. But working on enhancing the images we ensured that each slide captured the emotional intensity we wanted, especially in critical moments like Chatney’s system overload.

In conclusion, the project successfully conveyed the message we intended to send, and users were able to relate to the story and the graphics. The use of interactive elements made the experience more engaging, and the visual improvements ensured the comic met our desired aesthetic. Moving forward, we would like to experiment further with adding dynamic animations to make the user experience even more immersive.
