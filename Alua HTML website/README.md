Project Name: Who Is Your Antistress?

Project Description: This project is a stress-relief-themed website centered around animals, specifically dogs, horses, hamsters, and the NYUAD campus cats. The overall concept is to create a calming and visually appealing platform where users can learn about how interacting with these animals can help reduce stress. The site includes embedded YouTube videos, animal-themed pages with images and explanations, and interactive features like hover effects. The "Contact Me" section allows users to validate their email and then redirects them to Gmail to write me an email.

The main goal is to build an attractive and user-friendly space where visitors can watch videos, navigate through different animal categories, and learn about the stress-relief benefits these animals offer. With interactive buttons, gradient backgrounds, and subtle animations, the experience is crafted to be calming and immersive while keeping the content engaging.

Process

Conceptualization: The concept was inspired by the role animals play in relieving stress. I decided to highlight some of the most popular animals (dogs, horses, hamsters, and cats) known for their calming effects. I also wanted the website to include a fun and interactive video about the famous NYUAD campus cats.

Initial Planning: I began with a wireframe that included multiple buttons and pages dedicated to different animals that help relieve stress. Initially, I had three side buttons, but after evaluating user interaction, I replaced them with a single button linking to the Instagram page about campus cats. This decision simplified navigation and reduced visual clutter.

Design & Layout: Each animal has its own page with carefully chosen images, descriptions, and hover effects for interactive engagement. I used flexbox for layout to ensure the images and text were well aligned and consistent across various devices.
I chose a gradient background for a modern and clean aesthetic, emphasizing soothing colors such as white-gray and warm hues.
The main heading uses subtle hover effects and decorative lines to draw attention without overwhelming the user.
Circular buttons allow users to navigate between different animal pages. These buttons are styled to be responsive and interactive, scaling and changing colors upon hovering.

Video Integration: The website features an embedded YouTube video about campus cats. I ensured it was styled within a video frame to provide a structured and professional appearance.

Email Validation and Redirection: The "Contact Me" section included input validation using JavaScript. If the email input is valid, the user is redirected to Gmail to compose an email using their provided email.

Interactivity & Animation: To give buttons an interactive feel, subtle animations and hover effects were applied. A dynamic time display was added to show the current time, enhancing user engagement. Email validation was included for the contact section to ensure smooth communication and functionality. 

Mobile-Friendly Design: I ensured the layout and design were responsive, with elements like buttons and text resizing and adjusting to fit various screen sizes. The smooth scroll effect further contributes to a seamless browsing experience.

Color Scheme and Visuals: I utilized gradients and soft tones for backgrounds, aiming for a calming, professional aesthetic. For each page, I tailored the background to match the specific animal, creating a cohesive, visually soothing experience.

Evaluation 

Initially, my expectations were to create a highly interactive and visually appealing site with multiple buttons and extensive navigation. However, throughout the process, I realized that simplicity improved user experience. By reducing clutter, such as replacing the three side buttons with a single Instagram button, the site became more focused and less overwhelming.

Moreover, the email validation feature was a success, working seamlessly and enhancing user interaction by directly allowing them to connect via email. Overall, the final website met my goals of being mobile-friendly, visually engaging, and informative, offering users a calming and streamlined experience.
