                    <p>Taking care of a hamster (feeding, cleaning, playing) establishes a routine, which can offer stability and help alleviate stress. The act of caring for another living creature can shift your focus away from stressful thoughts.</p>

                    <p>Having a hamster provides companionship without the complexity of human relationships. They offer unconditional presence, which can help reduce feelings of loneliness and anxiety.</p>

                    <p>Hamsters are naturally curious and playful, and observing their behavior - such as running on a wheel, climbing tubes, or chewing on toys - can be entertaining and serve as a positive distraction from stress.</p>
